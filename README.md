# Mechanical Design Portfolio

This repository hosts my mechanical engineering design portfolio as concise, reproducible case studies.
Each project includes: requirements, CAD outputs, drawings, renders, and lightweight verification notes.

## Portfolio structure
- `/projects/` — individual case studies
- `/templates/` — reusable project template

## Projects
- 0001 — Bracket redesign case study (template) — in progress
- 0002 — Parametric part + drawing pack — planned
- 0003 — Small mechanism concept + documentation — planned

## How to use this repo
Open a project folder in `/projects/` and start with its `README.md`.
