# 0001 — Case Study Template

This is a starter project folder to establish the structure and quality bar for future projects.

## 1. Problem
Describe what is being designed or improved, for whom, and why.

## 2. Requirements and constraints
- Functional requirements:
- Loads and boundary conditions:
- Geometry envelope:
- Materials:
- Manufacturing constraints:
- Standards and safety considerations:
- Success metrics:

## 3. Approach
- Concept options considered:
- Selection logic:
- Key assumptions:

## 4. CAD and documentation
- Tools used:
- File outputs (STEP/STL/PDF):
- Drawing set summary:

## 5. Verification
- Hand calculations:
- FEA/Simulation (if any):
- Sensitivity checks:

## 6. Results
- Final mass:
- Key dimensions:
- Safety factor / margins:
- Cost/lead time notes:

## 7. What I would improve next
- Next iteration plan:
- Risks / unknowns to reduce:

## 8. Artifacts
